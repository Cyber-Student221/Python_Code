"""Description:
This code is a Python script that takes user input for a novel and creates multiple text files, 
one for each chapter, prologue, epilogue, and any side stories. The input is processed and split into paragraphs of a specified chunk size (number of words per paragraph). 
The text files are saved in a directory named after the novel's title."""
